    <h2>9. COOKIES AND OTHER TRACKING TECHNOLOGIES</h2>

    <h3>A. Description of the Technologies</h3>
    <p>We as well as third parties that provide the content, advertising, or other functionality on the Services may use
        Technologies to automatically collect information through your use of the Services. The following describes some
        of these Technologies we may use for this automatic data collection:</p>
    <ul>
        <li><strong>Cookies:</strong> A cookie is a small data file stored on the hard drive of your computer either for (a)
            the duration of your visit on a website ("session cookies") or (b) for a fixed period ("persistent cookies").
            Cookies contain information that can later be read by a web server. We may use cookies to provide you with a
            more personal and interactive experience on the Services.</li>
        <li><strong>Web Beacons:</strong> Web beacons are small files that are embedded in webpages, applications, and emails
            (also known as "clear gifs", "pixel tags", "web bugs", and "single-pixel gifs") that collect information about
            engagement on our Services. For example, web beacons allow us to track who has visited those webpages or
            opened an email, to test the effectiveness of our marketing, and for other related website statistics.</li>
        <li><strong>JavaScripts:</strong> JavaScripts are code snippets embedded in various parts of websites and applications
            that facilitate a variety of operations including accelerating the refresh speed of certain functionality or
            monitoring usage of various online components.</li>
        <li><strong>Entity Tags:</strong> Entity Tags are HTTP code mechanisms that allow portions of websites to be stored or
            "cached" within your browser and validates these caches when the website is opened, accelerating website
            performance since the web server does not need to send a full response if the content has not changed.</li>
        <li><strong>HTML5 Local Storage:</strong> HTML5 local storage allows data from websites to be stored or "cached" within
            your browser to store and retrieve data in HTML5 pages when the website is revisited.</li>
        <li><strong>Resettable Device Identifiers:</strong> Resettable device identifiers (also known as "advertising
            identifiers") are similar to cookies and are found on many mobile devices and tablets (for example, the
            "Identifier for Advertisers" or "IDFA" on Apple iOS devices and the "Google Advertising ID" on Android devices),
            and certain streaming media devices. Like cookies, resettable device identifiers are used to make online
            advertising more relevant.</li>
    </ul>

    <h3>B. Our Uses of the Technologies</h3>
    <p>We may also use these technologies for security purposes, to facilitate navigation, to display information more
        effectively, and to better serve you with more tailored information, as well as for website administration

        the design and functionality, to understand how users use our websites, and to assist us with resolving questions
        regarding use of the websites.</p>

    <h3>C. Mechanisms to Control Cookies and Other Technologies</h3>
    <p>You may be able to set your browser to reject cookies and certain other technologies by adjusting the appropriate
        settings in your browser. Each browser is different, but many common browsers have preferences that may be
        adjusted to allow you to either accept or reject cookies and certain other technologies before they are set or
        installed, or allow you to remove or reject the use or installation of certain technologies altogether. We
        recommend that you refer to the “Help” menu in your browser to learn how to modify your browser settings. Please
        note that you cannot remove Flash cookies simply by changing your browser settings. To learn how you can manage
